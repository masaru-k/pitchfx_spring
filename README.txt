"pitchrx data prep upload version" uses pitchrx and mlbgameday packages to scrape games between 2013 and 2018, then calculates game-by-game pitcher stats from those games.
The code requires the pitchrx and mlbgameday packages to be installed and the 'woba_event_list.csv' file in the working directory
"spring vel drop model code" produces the stats and analysis used in the articles.
Please do not ask me coding questions, I am not an expert at R or coding in general as anyone who knows anything who sees this code will realize.
Thank you for visiting!
